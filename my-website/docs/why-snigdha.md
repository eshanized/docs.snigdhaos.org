# Why "SNIGDHA" OS?

According to wikipedia, **SNIGDHA** is a **SANSKRIT** Word. But **"SNIGDHA OS"** has been named after my wife **"SNIGDHA"**. I wanted to make this Operating System as **Light-Weight**, **Powerful** and **Optimized**. But the word **"SNIGDHA"** has some other meanings also e.g: **Elegant, Smooth, Graceful, Kind, Affectionate**. Among them **Elegant, Smooth** are also some of the characteristics of **"SNIGDHA OS"**.
