This ensures that users have access to the latest software and updates without having to reinstall the operating system.

Pacman is a powerful and efficient package manager that handles package installation, upgrades, removals, and dependency resolution. It also supports transactional package upgrades and rollbacks.

**Arch User Repository (AUR)**: The Arch User Repository is a community-driven repository that contains a vast collection of user-contributed packages.

The AUR allows users to easily install software that is not available in the official repositories.

**Cutting-Edge Software**: Arch based linux distrubution typically offers the latest stable releases of software packages, allowing users to take advantage of new features and improvements as soon as they are available.

Overall, Arch based linux distrubution is well-suited for users who prefer a DIY approach, enjoy customization, and value simplicity and flexibility in their operating system. However, it may not be suitable for beginners or users who require a more user-friendly and stable system out of the box. But I tried to make it user friendly from beginners to advance level.
